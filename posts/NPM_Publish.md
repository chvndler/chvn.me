Once you’re up-and-running, publishing an npm package can be as easy as typing npm publish into the terminal. But setting up your package for the first time, testing it locally and writing a useful README can be tricky if you’re a first-timer.

Recently, I published my first public npm package. I solved a problem which applied to multiple of my personal projects, and so I thought — in case anyone else had the same issue — why not make the code publically-available as an npm package?
