## Overview

[YouTube](https://youtube.com) has cemented itself as the number one video sharing platform. Its vibrant community of creators is growing exponentially.

Tracking metrics about your channel is an integral part of measuring your success.
YouTube provides [a Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs), which allows you to integrate the platform directly into your website.
Since I'm a [YouTube Creator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZMli3czZnd1uoc1ShTouQw), I wanted to see how many times my subscriber count and views directly on my site.

## Getting Access to YouTube

To gain access to the YouTube API, you need to:

- Go to the [Google Developer Console.](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Create a new project.
- Credentials -> Create Credentials -> Service-account key.
- Click "Enable APIs and services."
- Find "YouTube Data API v3" and enable it.

Since we're communicating server-to-server, we'll need a [service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).

- Go to your [service accounts](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page.
- Create a service account.
- Click "Create Key" and choose JSON.

You should now have a JSON file similar to this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "...",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "...",
  "client_email": "...",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
}
```

We use this key later to set up our client in our API Route.
Okay, back to the [service account](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
We need to delegate [domain-wide authority](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority).

- On the table row, click Actions -> Edit.
- Show Domain-Wide Delegation -> Enable G-Suite Domain-Wide Delegation.

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰ You now have access to make requests to the YouTube API with your service account.

## Creating an environment variable

To securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request.
We also _do not_ want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable.

Since I'm deploying with [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I can add the secrets via their CLI.
We only need a few of the values from the JSON file. For the private key, make sure you convert
the new line characters (`\n`) to actual new lines.

```bash
$ vc secret add -- google-private-key "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvQIBA
..
..
2DAVOW4c=
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
$ vc secret add google-client-email my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
$ vc secret add google-client-id 721877721877
```

To reference these values locally when using `vc dev`, they need to be added to your `.env` file.

```bash
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nDVOW4c=\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=my-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Finally, we need to add the secrets to our `vercel.json`.

```json:vercel.json
{
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY": "@google-private-key",
    "GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL": "@google-client-email"
  }
}
```

We can now reference the secrets via `process.env.GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in our API route.
