Choosing a service to store data can be confusing and overwhelming for a front-end developer.
What are all these acronyms? Are the Amazon services named strange on purpose? These and many other questions
await your journey into the back-end.

As a front-end developer turned full-stack, I've spent more time than I'd like to admit trying to figure out the backend.
Because the backend is harder to _visualize_, I struggled to understand how the pieces fit together. Luckily, I soon found
out I wasn't alone. There's a support group when confused front-end engineers meet called Twitter.

Consider this article a "choose your own adventure" piece. I'll ask questions about your requirements
and then present a few options. Before we can begin our journey, I must first explain the basics. You can
also jump to the [list of services](/blog/backend#list-of-services) directly.

## Backend Basics

What is this scary place, **the back-end?** You can boil it down to this:

- You need a place to store data ([database](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/what-are-databases))
- You need a method of retrieving the data ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface))

As a front-end engineer, you've probably worked with APIs before. They allow you to fetch data from some database, somewhere.
On a long enough timeline, you'll eventually need to build your own API or
work with an existing codebase that has a back-end. This brings us to our first question.

## Do You Even Need a Database?

You need a place to store data, right? Here are some questions to consider:

- Can the data live alongside the code?
- Can the data be tracked with source control?
- Do non-technical people need to modify the data?
- Do you need different levels of access?

If you can store your data with your code in [source control](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/source-control),
you might be fine using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
with [git](https://git-scm.com/) â€“ that's what [this blog](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) uses.
It's also worth mentioning you _could_ use JSON files as a pseudo-database if you fall into this category.

However, you're likely reading this article because **you need a database**. Before we start learning about how you can create
your own backend, you might also consider a low-code solution.

## Low Code Solutions

Since you're a front-end developer, you might be able to utilize a low code solution.
These low code tools are arguably the fastest way to get access to some remote data.

Common examples include [Google Sheets](https://github.com/franciscop/use-spreadsheet) or [Airtable](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-airtable/)
as a database. There are other services that provide an [API abstraction](https://nocodeapi.com/) on a variety of data sources.

## Terms To Understand

Okay, so you need a database and it's going to require code.
First, I need to explain some terms you'll likely run into.

### SQL / NoSQL

A SQL database contains [relational data](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/comparing-database-types#relational-databases-working-with-tables-as-a-standard-solution-to-organize-well-structured-dataauthentication). Consider a social media site with a table for `users` and `posts`.
Every user represents a row in the `users` table.
Each user can have many different `posts`. There is a **relation** between a post and the user.
These relations makes it easy to look up different pieces of data through queries.

NoSQL databases are (generally) document-oriented. Unlike a SQL database, there are no tables or rows.
Instead, you store data in documents, which get organized into collections.
For example, in [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model) each document contains a set of key-value pairs.
This is a great option for large collections of small documents.

### GraphQL / REST

APIs allow programs to talk to each other. [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) are simply two different ways to fetch data. For example, here's a
`GET` request to fetch the number of views for a blog post.

```bash
$ curl https://leerob.io/api/page-views?id=databases

{ "total": 1234 }
```

GraphQL is an open-source [specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) for how to query your APIs.
Converting the previous example from REST to a GraphQL query might look like this.

```graphql
{
  post(id: "databases") {
    views
  }
}
```

If you want to learn more, [here's an excellent resource](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-vs-rest/).

### Authentication / Authorization

[Authentication](https://dataguide.prisma.io/postgresql/authentication-and-authorization/intro-to-authn-and-authz#what-are-authentication-and-authorization) verifies who a user is, while [authorization](https://dataguide.prisma.io/postgresql/authentication-and-authorization/intro-to-authn-and-authz#what-are-authentication-and-authorization) verifies what they have access to.
You'll commonly see this abbreviated as AuthN (Authentication) and AuthZ (Authorization).

If you're building any application that has users or requires limiting access to certain areas, you'll need to consider both of these.

### Hosted / Self-Hosted

Your database can either be hosted (managed by someone else) or self-hosted.
When backend services are open-source, it generally means there is an option to self-host.

If you don't want to deal with infrastructure, use a hosted service.

### Serverless

Serverless allows you to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
You only pay when your code runs. With a traditional server, it's always running.
In general, serverless should have less maintenance. There are, however, [tradeoffs](https://www.serverless.com/blog/when-why-not-use-serverless).

It's worth mentioning how you deploy your front-end might impact which back-end service you choose.
For example, if you use [Next.js](/blog/learn-nextjs) and server-side rendering, each page generates a [serverless function](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/what-is-a-serverless-function/).
At a large enough scale, you'll run into issues where there are too many open connections to your database. A common solution
for this is connection pooling. For more information, check out [Prisma's deployment documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/deployment).

### Data Modeling

When learning about databases, you might hear terms like [one-to-many](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)>)
and [many-to-many](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)>). These are ways of modeling your database relationships.
[Database normalization](https://dataguide.prisma.io/intro/intro-to-schemas) is
how you organize a database into tables and columns.

## Levels of Abstraction

Every situation is unique. There are _many_ tools that exist to solve the same problem. By understanding what you're looking for,
it will help you choose the right solution. First, let's understand _what_ you're trying to build.

- Are you building this backend for yourself?
- Will other people need to use it / support it?
- Are you trying to build a [Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)?

Personally, I like to experiment with new technologies when I'm creating personal projects. If I'm
picking a tool for my day job, I'll likely default to one that's well-adopted in the industry and has
robust support. There's more control picking a backend when you're a solo-founder building the entire
tech stack yourself. As you introduce other engineers into the mix, things get more complicated.

If you need something fast, you'll want a higher-level abstraction. These services typically provide a client or API
out of the box that reduces the amount of boilerplate code you need to write. This is commonly referred to as
automating the [CRUD (Create, read, update and delete)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) portion of your backend.

Let's assume you want something more high-level, ideally with a website or interface to manage your data.
If you want complete control, you might consider [building your own](/blog/backend#build-your-own-backend).

## List of Services

I've crowdsourced a list of services you might consider using. Below, I'll give further insights into a few services I know well.
The reality is that each service listed here has its own tradeoffs. Hopefully this gives you a high-level overview to research more.
It's also worth mentioning the service you already know well might be your best choice.
Here's some questions to consider.

- Does your backend need to be built on open-source technology?
- What level of vendor lock-in are you comfortable with?
- Are there are security considerations your company/client has?
- How much do you want to build yourself vs. rely on a service?
- Do you need social login? (Sign in with Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Do you have an existing database you're trying to improve access to?
