I'm Chandler Chappell, most call me Chan.
I am a Front-end Developer, Designer, and Director located in Charlotte, NC. As of when the post is being typed, I am currently building ( ady )Â® _Atelier Design Yield_, to calm the noise within the design culture.
I spend most of my time writing code, tweeting, and learning about things that interest me.
