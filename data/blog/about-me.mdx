Hi, I'm Chandler Chappell, most call me Chan.

I am a front-end developer, designer, and director located in Charlotte, NC. As of when the post is being typed, I am currently building ( ady )Â® _Atelier Design Yield_, to calm the noise within the design culture.
I spend most of my time writing code, tweeting, and learning about things that interest me.

This journal will document my thoughts, ideas, and any resources that have shaped me as a designer and story-teller. I plan to also use this space as my own knowledge base for all things dev.

Thank you for reading this.
